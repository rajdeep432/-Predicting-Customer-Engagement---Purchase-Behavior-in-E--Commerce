# -Predicting-Customer-Engagement---Purchase-Behavior-in-E--Commerce

This project aims to analyze the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset to understand customer
engagement with product-related pages, identify factors influencing purchasing decisions, and discover relationships
between different visitor attributes. By employing linear regression, hypothesis testing, and exploratory data analysis
(EDA), the study seeks to provide insights for improving the website's user experience and increasing the likelihood of
making a purchase.

Data Description: The dataset consists of 12,330 sessions from an online retail store, with each session characterized by
18 attributes. For the purposes of this project, "ProductRelated_Duration" will be used as a continuous target variable to
predict customer engagement with product-related pages.


# Introduction 
Understanding customer behavior and preferences in the e-commerce industry is critical for businesses to
optimize their websites and increase conversion rates. This project will explore the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention
Dataset, which contains information about online shopping sessions and customer attributes. By analyzing the dataset,
we aim to predict customer engagement, represented by ProductRelated_Duration, and explore factors influencing
purchasing decisions.

# Methodology

       1. Data Preprocessing: Before analysis, data preprocessing steps will be performed, including handling missing
          values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding). The continuous
          variables will be scaled/normalized if necessary.
       2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA will be conducted to understand the data's structure, discover patterns, and
          identify relationships between variables. Techniques will include univariate analysis (e.g., histograms, box plots),
          bivariate analysis (e.g., scatter plots, correlation matrix), and multivariate analysis (e.g., pair plots, parallel
          coordinate plots).
       3. Hypothesis Testing: Various hypothesis tests will be performed to explore relationships between variables and
          identify significant differences between visitor groups. Examples may include t-tests, chi-square tests, one-way
          ANOVA, Pearson correlation tests, and two-proportion Z-tests.
       4. Linear Regression: A linear regression model will be fit to predict the ProductRelated_Duration based on selected
          independent variables. Model assumptions will be checked, and variable selection techniques will be applied to
          identify the most influential factors.
          
Expected Outcomes: By analyzing the dataset, we expect to identify factors that significantly influence customer
engagement and purchasing decisions. The findings will provide insights for improving the website's user experience,
optimizing marketing strategies, and increasing conversion rates.
Conclusion: The project will provide a comprehensive analysis of online shopping behavior using linear regression,
hypothesis testing, and EDA. The results will contribute to a better understanding of customer engagement and purchase
behavior, ultimately aiding businesses in enhancing their online presence and increasing revenue.
